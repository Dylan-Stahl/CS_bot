# CS_bot

## Application Need Scenario
As a career advisor for a university experiencing an increasing number of computer science students, I have spent a lot of time working with these students to 
determine what job types they are interested in. A new chatbot solution has been created to reduce workloads for career advisors. The chatbot can identify five
job types for computer science students based on their strengths and preferences. The chatbot interface is easy to use; it provides buttons, pictures, and an 
explanation for incorrect input data. The AIML elements include a carousel, images, buttons, and links.
